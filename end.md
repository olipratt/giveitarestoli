## Testing

To load a schema from file - add this little snippet to it.

```json
{
  "host": "127.0.0.1:5000",
   "schemes":[
      "http"
   ],
   ...
}
```

===

## Security

- *"Oh but I'm not using any security"*
- Docs lie

```
client = Client(Security(App(schema_path)))
```

===

## Specifying Endpoints

- There are a couple of ways of doing it.
